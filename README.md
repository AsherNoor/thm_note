# thm_note
A simple note creator for TryHackMe rooms.
<br>This is my own creation, and not associated but inspired by TryHackMe.
<p>
I'm an avid TryHackMe user, and I'm also an avid Note Taker when in these rooms.
</br>I found that everytime I start a room, I always create a text file with the room infomation, and the number of tasks.
</br>This allows me to easily go back to the room, or to look up how I did something.
</p>

<p>
The <b>THM Note</b> simply speeds this process up for me.
</br>It will ask me 3 simple prompts, and gives me a the text file to use.
</br>What took me a couple of minutes, now only takes me seconds.
</p>

<p>
It will ask you for the following:
  </br>The Room Name:
  </br>The Room URL:
  </br>The Number of Tasks:
</br>That's it.
</br>It will actually create the "Tasks" section for you, based on the number of tasks you give it.
</p>

<p>
In this Repo you will find a couple of things.
  </br>The Source Code: thm_note.py
  </br>The Executable: THM Note.exe (This can be run on Windows with no installtion requirements)
</p>

<p>
I hope you find this helpful.
</br>Happy Hacking.
